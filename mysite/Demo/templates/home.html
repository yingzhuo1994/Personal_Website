    <h1>Preface</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>You could know many things about me, especially relevant to computer science.</p>

    <h1>My CS Study</h1>

    <p><b>Sep, 2012</b></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em; padding-left: 2em;">I entered Hunan University and started to study my first CS course, Introduction to Computer Science. This course was based on C language.</p>

    <p><b>Mar, 2013</b></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em; padding-left: 2em;">I took the National Computer Rank Examination (NCRE) of C Programming Language. To pass this exam, I read two books (more than 600 pages) and finished all exercises within one month. Due to my good preparations, I completed the exam in only half of the required time, and I was the first person to leave the exam room. Finally, I passed this exam and got an A-level certificate.</p>

    <p><b>Apr, 2013</b></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em; padding-left: 2em;">I was taking my second CS course, Fundamentals of Programming. 
        My teacher assigned a project that was difficult for novices. 
        I still remembered some details though many years had passed. 
        This project was a poker game, which required us to implement functions like shuffle, sorting, comparison and so on. 
        Only a few students completed this project and I was one of them. 
        My work impressed my teacher, and he promised that he would teach me how to implement multiplayer functionality. 
        However, he didnâ€™t do it. 
        And this became one of the regrets of my college days.</p>

    <p><b>Sep, 2016</b></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em; padding-left: 2em;">I became a graduate and focused on the research about bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM). BWIM theory is to get the weight of moving vehicles without interrupt traffic. I studied the influence line (IL) algorithm and came up a modified IL algorithm to considering the change of vehicle speed. The algorithm was implemented via MATLAB.</p>

    <p><b>Sep, 2020</b></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em; padding-left: 2em;">I decided to study python systematically due to the popularity of it, and Python for Everybody is my first python course. It was a good start to continue my computer science study.</p>
